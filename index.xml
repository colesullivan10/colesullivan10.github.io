      <description>Growing up watching Sunday Night Football with my dad is a tradition I cherished.As we all know, you can’t just watch sports, there’s always a debate going on.That is were the stat Time Of Possession became my main focal point inpredicting playoff teams. Hopefully with the next three graphs I can get you tobelieve just like me.
When looking at the NFL one of the most important ways to win games is to scorepoints.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
